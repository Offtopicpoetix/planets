The red planet was vary red, it was red and more redder than red, and it was dusty.
Sometimes it was a little pink, sometimes a little purple but it was always dusty for some reason, time for science! 
Why so dusty. That's a good question, must be because there's a lot of lint.
I wonder how hot it is. Too hot for spuds.
